# Project Overview
The challenge for this project was to create a "full stack" application from scratch the included Node.js, Postgres, Express, and EJS.  

## Project Description
My project idea was to create a Wine Inventory application that would allow wine enthusiusts and collectors to track their collections, whether big or small. I wanted to make it easy to use with a simple, functional, and clean interface.
